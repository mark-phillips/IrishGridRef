V1.0 - Add (experimental) support for Irish Grid.  This uses a 7 parameter Helmert transform 
       so should be capable of +/-5m accuracy.  I have tested extensively with online data 
       sources and found my 10 figure grid ref calculations to be accurate to within 1 metre 
       of those given by:  http://www.fieldenmaps.info/cconv/cconv_ie.html        
       ...but I have not been able to test the results in the field.
         
       Please therefore treat the Irish grid ref values with caution until you have been able 
       to verify their accuracy.  In other words do not rely on them as your sole source of 
       navigation data until this feature has had some time to prove itself.
